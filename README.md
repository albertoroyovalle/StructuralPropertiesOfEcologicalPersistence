# Structural Properties of Ecological Persistence - Thesis Research


This repository contains the research materials and code implementations related to the Master's Thesis titled "Structural Properties of Ecological Persistence." 


## Contents

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Code**: Original code implementations related to network/graph theory applications, nestedness metrics computation, and ecological system generation algorithms.

- **Accesory Figures**: A collection of figures used in the thesis and accesory plots involving NF metric.

- **TFM document**:  Presents the final master's thesis, built upon the code experiments. This document provides a comprehensive context for the implemented algorithms and methodologies.
